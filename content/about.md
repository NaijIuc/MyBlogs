title: About
---

I am an aspiring data scientist who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from multiple biological disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different platforms. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in systems biology, molecular biology, statistics, and data science.


My passion lies in solving biological problems with tailored data and algorithms and communicating complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders. I am able to jump across verticals to deliver high-performing solutions.
